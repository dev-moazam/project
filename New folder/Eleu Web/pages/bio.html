        Eleu is a Uruguayan DJ/producer. Since he was a child, he has been
        passionate about electronic music, listening to artists like Tiesto. It
        was this passion that led him to complete his DJ studies in 2019 and
        start his career, making his debut that same year and sharing the stage
        with important national and international artists such as Matt Sassari,
        Mt93, Cosani, and Coyu. He has also had the opportunity to spend time
        with these artists outside of the DJ booth and has learned a lot from
        artists like Metodi Hristov, Weska, Joyhauser, Nakadia, and The Yellow
        Heads. In 2020, he started producing music after taking Ableton classes
        with the Argentine producer Emaxx Cost. In 2022, he expanded his
        knowledge by studying FL Studio with the Uruguayan producer Galoop. As a
        result, he has been able to release music on labels from Germany,
        Russia, Spain, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and more. This year, he had
        the most important release of his career on a globally recognized label.
        In the beginning, he was associated with progressive and melodic techno,
        which not only gives him versatility but also allows him to create
        unique moments in his sets that are filled with techno, which he likes
        to call Techno Clubber, and deep melodies. If you want to dance from
        start to finish, don't miss out on listening to Eleu.
